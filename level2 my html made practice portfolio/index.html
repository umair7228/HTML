            <!--****************************-->
            <!--Web Development with HTML and CSS-->
            <b><u>Web Development with HTML and CSS</u></b>
            <p>I further expanded my skill set by learning HTML and CSS, the essential building blocks of web development. One of my key projects was:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Amazon Clone:</b> I created a basic clone of the Amazon website, which helped me understand web design fundamentals and responsive layouts.</li>
            </ul>
            <!--****************************-->
            <!--Exploring TypeScript with the Governor Sindh Initiative-->
            <b><u>Exploring TypeScript with the Governor Sindh Initiative</u></b>
            <p>Currently, I am learning TypeScript under the Governor Sindh Initiative for GenAI, Web3, and Metaverse, guided by Sir Isfhan Ahmed. TypeScript has been a significant upgrade, offering robust static typing and powerful tooling. Key concepts I’ve mastered include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><b>Functions and Methods: </b>From basic to arrow functions and return functions.</li>
            <li><b>Array Operations: </b>Mastering methods like map, filter, and reduce.</li>
            <li><b>Callback Functions: </b>Effectively handling asynchronous operations.</li>
            </ul>
            <!--*********************************-->
